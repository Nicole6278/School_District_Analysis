# School_District_Analysis

***Overview***

  Academic integrity is an issue any educational institution faces. For this challenge, the school board suspects academic integrity issues are present within their school system. The board has asked for assistance with re-analyzing the student results previously prepared. Adjustments were to be made to the math anc reading scores prior to re-evaluating result data.
  
  This challenge required the student to perform a plethora of Python functions using Pandas libraries. Students tested their knowledge with combining dictionaries, cleaning lists, and replacing data. To the student, it seemed as if every bit of knowledge garnered through the modulues and lessons were put to the test. It was very definitely a challenge. 
  
***Results***
- How is the district summary affected?
